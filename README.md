This repository is a demo on how to create mybinder for educational purpose. There are notebooks that can be used to explore vrs and vrs-python. 

Getting started: 

1) Click this link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SalemBajjali/educational_notebooks/HEAD)
NOTE: This link might take a few minutes to load.

2) Once JupyterLabs loaded click on the terminal Icon. Inside of the terminal copy: pip install ga4gh.vrs[extras]

NOTE: This should download the nessary packages needed. Currently working on how we can avoid this step. 

3) Once the installations are done. You can go ahead and interact with the notebook!
